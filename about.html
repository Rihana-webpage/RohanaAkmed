      <h1>About me</h1> 
      <p>
        I'm Rihana Akmed, an 11th-grade student at Kegna Academy School in Ethiopia. Ever since I was young, I've been passionate about justice and helping others, which is why my biggest dream is to become a lawyer. I believe in standing up for what’s right and making a difference in people's lives.

Aside from my studies, I find joy in singing—whether it's to relax or express my emotions, music has always been a big part of my life. Being a student keeps me busy, but I stay focused on my goals, knowing that hard work will take me where I want to be.
